# Turtle Map Notes

`Turtle Map Notes` is a standalone map notes addon for Turtle WoW.

It adds manual map notes, edit/delete dialogs, map coordinates, and automatic profession node notes for Mining and Herbalism.

## Features

- **Manual map notes**
  - `Ctrl + Right Click` on World Map to create a note at cursor location.
  - `Left Click` an existing note to edit its name.
  - `Right Click` an existing note to delete it (with confirmation dialog).
- **Tooltips**
  - Hover a note icon to show its note name.
- **Coordinates on map**
  - Bottom-left: cursor coordinates.
  - Bottom-right: player coordinates.
- **Automatic profession notes**
  - Auto-adds notes when gathering **Mining** and **Herbalism** nodes.
  - Uses profession-specific node icons (ore/herb icons), similar to Cartographer modules.
- **Per-map persistence**
  - Notes are saved per map/zone in `TurtleMapNotesDB`.
